1. **Bronze Layer**  
   Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.

2. **Silver Layer**  
   Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3. **Gold Layer**  
   Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema, ready for reporting and analytics.
